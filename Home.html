    <p>With every breath we take, every drop we drink, we're connected to the ocean. <br>
        Our planet depends on the vitality of the ocean to
         support and sustain it. But <br>our ocean faces major threats: global climate change, pollution, habitat destruction,<br> invasive
          species, and a dramatic decrease in ocean fish stocks. These threats to the <br>ocean are so extensive that 
          more than 40 percent of the ocean has
         been severely <br>affected and no area has been left untouched. Consequently, humanity is losing <br>the food,
          jobs, and critical environmental services that a healthy ocean generates.<br>
           National Geographic Society's Ocean Initiative aims to restore health and <br>
           productivity to the ocean by inspiring people to care and act,
          reducing the impact <br>of fishing, and promoting the creation of marine protected areas.
